## Introduction: 

The main motivation behind this project was the application of data mining algorithms along with the use of analytical thinking approach to solve a problem. In the process of the project completion, we would also get familiar to various processes involved in data mining such as data gathering, pre-processing, exploration and various types of algorithms such as classification, clustering, association rules.
Our motivation behind choosing this problem and this dataset was very straight forward. The data set was simple in structure (just numeric values), there were no complex fields, it had sufficient number of instances (overfitting or underfitting is avoided). This problem would also help us in achieving the project objective. 

The report first starts with data exploration wherein we have described how we came to choose the dataset to work on. The Data Pre-processing; we have stated how we cleaned the dataset before applying the algorithm to make the model. Which algorithm gave the best result. The performance measure we used namely, the 10-fold cross validation. We have then gone on to write down our experiences using the Logic of Thinking Procedure. The advantages of using it and its benefits we bore. Finally, we concluded by comparing the models acquired by using the various models. Mentioning the patterns we discovered and which model works best and also the results we came upon.

## Data Exploration:

The dataset used came from the University of California Irvineâ€™s Machine Leaning repository. We have used for our dataset, twenty-five thousand instances. The dataset contains eleven attributes out of which one is the goal or the class value. 

## Platform Used:

* Weka
